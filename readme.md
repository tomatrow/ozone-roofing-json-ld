# Schema for Ozone Roofing

This entire script is just for json-ld.

Webflow kind of has a backend, I could a setup a server/function, call their API, and construct the structured data that way, but, this site isn't likely to change anytime soon.

## Usage

See the github section of [this feature list](https://www.jsdelivr.com/features).

It's something like:

```
<script src="3bc9e537b73b8d60b433af9f8b5f7fb7885a2c36
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tomatrow/ozone-roofing-json-ld@3bc9e537b73b8d60b433af9f8b5f7fb7885a2c36/ozone-roofing-json-ld.js"></script>
```

If we use commits/versions then we don't have to deal with cacheing problems down the read.
